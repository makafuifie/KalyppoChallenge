The #kalypochallenge hit social media like wild fire when a propaganda post of the Presidential Candidate of the New Patriotic Party drinking kalypo hit social media. Members of the opposition New Patriotic Party turned the propaganda to their advantage and that got most party faithful taking pictures of themselves drinking kalypo. Party Executives have been seen on Social media drinking Kalypo in solidarity with their flag bearer. [  61 more words ],10/6/16 8:04 PM,239,

"KALYPO CHALLENGE (with logoligi straw) Promoting Made-in-Ghana products is not about just saying it and doing something else. John Mahama says we should use products made-in-Ghana, but he was wearing a Swiss-made Gold watch, and an Italian-made shoe. That kind of promotion doesn't work. Nana Addo didn't go about saying we should use made-in-Ghana products.... He was just captured doing what he does everyday, Sipping his made-in-Ghana Kalypo. Today, Kalypo is a Hot Cake, everyday Ghanaian is grabbing a made-in-Ghana Kalypo. The demand for Kalypo has soared, and the producers of Kalypo are manufacturing more boxes, and they are making huge profit. That's how we promote Made-in-Ghana products. Grab your Kalypo, Sip it through the 'Amelica logoligi' straw, Sip the nutritiously juicy juice in Confidence that Nana is coming to save our nation. As you sip the nutritiously juicy juice, you will see something (wo b£ hu ade£)  #kalypochallenge #kalypofrenzy #ariseforchange #iamforchange See More",10/7/16 9:38 AM,611,

"A prank with a three -sixty (360) intention to mock Nana Addo has metamorphose unto becoming the most creative campaign tool ever used in any elections in Ghana arguably over  the last 6 decades.  As writer and pro NDC  commentator Zuu Bukali Sadiq Tia II aptly observed after the trailblazing of the KalypoChallenge whitewash social media a day after the launch of the challenge.    ""I think this is one of the best political creativity of this season! It neutralized the effort ...to concentrate on non-issues to an effort that may win the party some love - at least from Kalyppo sellers and maybe the producers who are benefitting from the frenzy"" Any evil intent against Nana Addo ( the man who towers all Presidential candidates in this election )  will not work today or ever. The man  who's best fit to oversee the journey of this country going into the next phase of our national life starting with the roaring cry for change on Dec. 7th.   #ChangeIsComing #SakiaNazua #AriseForChange See More",10/8/16 11:44 AM,647,

A picture of the NPP’s Presidential nominee sipping Kalyppo fruit juice which was meant to possibly mock Nana Akuffo Addo has interestingly started a social media challenge. The challenge which is named ‘KalypoChallenge’ has caught on with a number of people believed to be pro-NPP. ￼ People who are supporting the challenge take pictures of themselves while sipping Kalyppo and post them on social media. A Facebook page has been created to enhance the challenge. The page is called ‘Kalyppo Movement for Nana.’ A visit to the Madina Market by Pulse.com.gh showed that vendors have run out of stock after the social media challenge started. ￼ See More",10/8/16 9:23 PM,921,

【明明是要嘲弄總統候選人，抹黑卻適得其反變爆紅】 近日，批評者們為了嘲弄民調領先的反對派總統候選人阿庫佛．艾杜，用推特散播一張他喝著卡力波果汁的照片，結果弄巧成拙，這張照片反而引起社群之間超夯的「卡力波挑戰」... #非洲 #迦納 #總統大選 #KalypoChallengeSee Translation,10/31/16 2:57 AM,691,
【嘲弄不成，反讓他成為網絡風潮】 ／批評者們為了嘲弄民調領先的反對派總統候選人，散播了一張他喝著卡力波果汁（Kalyppo）的照片——卡力波果汁是一個廣受當地學童歡迎的飲品。 然而，阿庫佛．艾杜的支持者讓那張照片變成一個突然爆紅的網路活動——卡力波挑戰（#KalypoChallenge）......／See Translation,10/31/16 5:00 AM,707,
"Where are the neutrals?!  The NPP was tagged as unserious because they posted selfies of taking Kalypo. The 'neutrals' said, instead of doing that, they could use that little time to explain their programs and policies. Note, no NPP official talked about Kalypo on a campaign platform at the time. It was just selfies circulating on Facebook.  Since then, no less a person than the Chief of Staff of the republic used 'precious campaign time' to caution citizens of the dangers of... contracting a disease known as 'kalypolitis'.  Not only that, former National organizer of the NDC, Mr Yaw Boateng Gyan also on a campaign platform, instead of sending his government's message, said that if Nana Addo can drink Kalypo, then he will suck breast when voted for.  Again, Ms Ama Benyiwaa Doe, former central regional minister and currently a member of the council of state also stated that only unserious adults drink Kalypo.  My question to the so called 'neutrals' is that, have they heard these statements from the NDC campaign platforms?? Can the neutrals also tell us what the policies and programs of the NDC are for the next 4years?? Have they heard the NDC propose any policies yet? Why then are our neutrals not seeking programs and policies from the NDC?! Why are they not telling them that it is waste of precious campaign time to talk about Kalypo on campaign platforms?? Or there are no more neutrals in the country??  Please credit us with some intelligence. You are not any neutral biara. You are just a disappointed NDC person who lacks the courage to admit it.  It's not too late though. You can join the wind of change.  #KalypoChallenge See More",10/31/16 6:43 AM,877,
